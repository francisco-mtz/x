 * # Intructions:
 *
 * Feel free to use whatever tool you want. AI included.

 *
 * # Requirements:
 *
 * Implemented a paginated view that will display the cards on a grid.
 *
 * ## Cards
 *
 * Build components to present both cards described in the design reference.
 *
 * The cards should have a size of 200px x 300px.
 *
 * The images on the card Type:1 should have 120px x 120px.
 *
 * Images should be centered covering the whole 120px square, cropped without distortions.
 *
 * Each type of item should be rendered by the correct type of card:
 *
 * - Items with type=1 should be rendered using card Type: 1
 * - Items with type=2 should be rendered using card Type: 2
 *
 * ## Themes
 *
 * Implement multiple themes.
 *
 * The theme `obsidian` has a black #000 background on elements.
 *
 * Theme `snow` has a grey #EAECEF background.
 *
 * ## Pagination
 *
 * Implement any type of pagination, including but not required infinite scrolling.
 *
 * If page-based pagination is implemented, each page should have at most 20 items.
 *
 * Loading states need to be considered.
 *
 * There are no requirements for any loading state as it will depend on the solution
 * It could be as simple as a "Loading..." text displaying on a div or a button.
 *
 * ## Data
 *
 * The data to be rendered is exposed through a mock API call using the `getItems` function.
 *
 * This function simulates the request delay and accepts `pageSize` and `page` arguments.
 *
 * The API returns the fetched items in the `items`.
 *
 * Information about pagination is returned in the `pagination` prop.
